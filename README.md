# CyberManagement
C &amp; Unix Group Project
Work in progress: Client, Server
Client Implementations: Terminal-based GUI, switch options for guest or member login, resizing menu, show menu of food, ...
Server Implementations: Data store for logins/ip, server info, interface for logging in and out, granting access/password,...

Problems encounter:
It is just checking the log in but does not provide any other information!
How many users are in the system, how much credit they have, how to check the security, how to keep track of the information being used, how to add a new user, how to remove a user!
These are the parts that each client server require.
You definitely can add more features to make it even stronger but that would be up to you.
