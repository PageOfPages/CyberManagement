# CyberManagement
C &amp; Unix Group Project
Work in progress: Implement user/admin features, user counts, credit counts, security checks, track of time (probably how much they have used the system before), add/delete users, etc.
Completed: Log in user



Problems encounter:
It is just checking the log in but does not provide any other information!
How many users are in the system, how much credit they have, how to check the security, how to keep track of the information being used, how to add a new user, how to remove a user!
These are the parts that each client server require.
You definitely can add more features to make it even stronger but that would be up to you.
